## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
y_opened = train$TARGET_B
# y_opened = cbind(as.numeric(unlist(data$unique_opened[1:16])), 
#                  as.numeric(unlist(data$delivered[1:16] - data$unique_opened[1:16])))
# y_clicks = cbind(as.numeric(unlist(data$unique_clicks[1:16])), 
#                  as.numeric(unlist(data$delivered[1:16] - data$unique_clicks[1:16])))

opened_reg_1 = glm(y_opened ~ mm - 1, family = 'binomial')
opened_coef_1 = coef(opened_reg_1)
# clicks_reg_1 = glm(y_clicks ~ data.mm - 1, family = 'binomial')
# clicks_coef_1 = coef(clicks_reg_1)

summary(opened_reg_1)
# summary(clicks_reg_1)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
